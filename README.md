## 1. Introduction

This repository contains a **comprehensive** end-to-end machine learning project aimed at predicting **loan approval** (Loan_Status) based on various borrower features (income, employment status, credit history, etc.). The project showcases:

- An extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA),
- **Data cleaning** and **feature engineering**,
- **Multiple classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.),
- A thorough **evaluation** (accuracy, confusion matrix, AUC),
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV,
- **Discussion of limitations** and **future improvements**.

**Goal**: Provide a template for a real-world data science workflow, from initial data inspection to final model tuning.

- `README.md`: The main documentation (what you’re reading now).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required libraries.

## 3. Dataset Information

The dataset (commonly from Kaggle or a local source) has columns such as:

- **Loan_ID**: Unique identifier.
- **Gender**: Applicant’s gender.
- **Married**: Applicant’s marital status.
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+).
- **Education**: Education level (Graduate/Not Graduate).
- **Self_Employed**: Self-employed status (Yes/No).
- **ApplicantIncome**: Monthly income of the applicant.
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Monthly income of the co-applicant.
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount in thousands.
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of the loan.
- **Credit_History**: Credit history flag (1 or 0).
- **Property_Area**: Urban, Semi-urban, or Rural.
- **Loan_Status**: Target variable (Y = approved, N = not approved).

---

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In [01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb](./notebooks/01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb), we:

- **Inspect** the dataset’s shape, columns, and data types.
- **Generate** statistical summaries (`df.describe()`) for both numeric and categorical features.
- **Visualize distributions** (histograms and boxplots) for key numeric columns such as `ApplicantIncome` and `LoanAmount`.
- **Plot countplots** for important categorical variables (e.g., `Gender`, `Property_Area`).
- **Examine relationships** between variables, including a correlation heatmap (especially focusing on `Credit_History` and its relation to `Loan_Status`).

**Key Findings** from EDA:

- There are **missing values** in columns like `Gender`, `LoanAmount`, and others.
- We observe **potential outliers** in income-related columns (`ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`).
- `Credit_History` appears to **strongly correlate** with loan approval (`Loan_Status`).

## 5. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Still working in [01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb](./notebooks/01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) (or moving on to a second notebook), we:

- **Handle missing values**:
  - For numeric data (e.g., `LoanAmount`), we typically fill with the median.
  - For categorical data (e.g., `Gender`), we fill with the mode.
- **Encode categorical variables**:
  - Map `Loan_Status` to `1` (Y) and `0` (N).
  - Apply one-hot encoding to columns like `Gender`, `Married`, `Property_Area`, etc.
- **Optionally create new features**, such as a combined `TotalIncome` or log-transforming skewed columns (`ApplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`) to mitigate outliers.

## 6. Modeling

In [02_model_building.ipynb](./notebooks/02_model_building.ipynb), we:

- **Train-Test Split**:
  - Use `train_test_split()` with an 80/20 ratio (or another split proportion).
  - Optionally use `stratify=y` if you want class distribution in train/test to mirror the full dataset.
- **Baseline Model**:
  - Train a **Logistic Regression** model as a quick baseline.
  - Evaluate with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Other Models** (e.g., **RandomForest**, **XGBoost**):
  - Fit, predict, and compare performance to see which algorithm works best.

---

## 7. Evaluation

For each model, we measure:

- **Accuracy**: Overall proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**: More detailed insight into classification performance (especially important if approving/rejecting loans has different real-world costs).
- **ROC Curve & AUC**: To visualize and quantify the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

Sample results might show:

- **Logistic Regression** achieving ~80–82% accuracy.
- **RandomForest** improving to ~85–88% after some tuning.

---

## 8. Results and Insights

- **Major Determinants**:

  - `Credit_History` often emerges as the single largest predictor for approval.
  - While higher incomes increase approval probability, they are not the only factor considered.

- **Confusion Matrix Observations**:
  - If **false negatives** are too high, it means many “would-be-approved” loans are rejected (potentially losing good customers).
  - If **false positives** are too high, it means approving loans that should be denied (increasing financial risk).

---

## 9. Hyperparameter Tuning

Using methods like **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**, we:

- **Tune RandomForest parameters** (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`).
- **Improve cross-validation accuracy** through systematic parameter searching.
- **Select the best estimator** and evaluate it on the test set to confirm gains over baseline models.

---

## 10. Limitations

### Limitations

- **Missing or limited borrower data**: Real-world approvals often consider additional metrics (e.g., credit scores, debt-to-income ratio, etc.).
- **Potential data imbalance** if `Y` vs. `N` is skewed.
- **Outliers** in `ApplicantIncome` or `CoapplicantIncome` can distort certain models.
